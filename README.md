# UdacityPortfolio
This is part of the Front-End Developer Course from Udacity.  

##Features
This is the portfolio project where we set up a portfolio site template from a PDF mockup to practice our HTML and CSS skills. The project also features media query breakpoints, and a flexbox responsive design.  It is still a work in progress, and there are many improvements still to be made as of 06/12/2018.
